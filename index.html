    <p>   One of the top 8 animals that are going extinct is the gorilla. 
        These are the reasons why they are becoming exotic. Like other endangered species, its decline is due primarily to gorilla hunting, habitat loss, disease, and human damage.
         as of june 2022 there are only about 200 to 300 adult cross river gollilas in the wild and another problem is this is gorilla they are slow to recover because they have a 
         low reproductive rate which means females only they can give birth every four or six years.

    <p>One of the top 8 animals that are going extinct are the Rhinos because. They are used in Traditional Chinese medicine and displayed as a status symbol and demonstration of wealth.
         They are so highly prized that a Javan rhino horn can sell for up to $30,000 per kg on the black marketn bercase can the consecuen of all of this is that tre of the five espesies
          are going exting and this are the tree of them Black Rhinos, also known as Hook-lipped Rhinos are actually grey. The black Rhinos are found in South Africa; their espese had declined
           by 96% between 1970 and 1992. In 1995 only 2,410 black Rhinos were left, but thanks to conservation efforts the population is starting to recover. The other specie that is at reasck
            id the Sumatran Rhino, also known as Hairy Rhino and the The Javan Rhino, also known as the Sunda Rhino

 <p>Next on our endangered species list are sea turtles. Two species of sea turtle are critically endangered sea turtles and the two espices that are bieng more afective are the Hawksbill 
    Turtle is one of the smallest species of turtle the main reason that thie tapy of turtles that are in danger is because they have beautiful patterned shell, and where it is most common 
    and inhabited is in the warm tropical coastal waters of the world's oceans, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. It is almost impossible to know with precision how many tortoises there
     are of their species, but research suggests that there are only 5 populations on the entire planet, which is made up of around 8,000 tortoises in total, and with only 1,000 females nesting annually.
     A curious fact These reptiles have existed for the last 100 million years.The leatherback turtle is the fourth largest reptile in the world and is the other species of turtle that is one step away from extinction.
      What is estimated is that the number of its global species has decreased by 40 percent in the last three generations. Another thing that has decreased is that the nesting of leatherback turtles in
       Malaysia has practically disappeared, decreasing from at least 10,000 nests in 1953 to only one or two nests per year since 2003. The peculiar thing about these turtles is that the sex of the hatchlings 
       It depends on the temperature of the nest. For example, for a male/female mix, the nest temperature should be approximately 85.1 degrees Fahrenheit or 29.5 degrees C. The interesting thing about these 
       turtles is that temperature can greatly affect the sex of the baby turtle, a higher temperature will result in more females and lower temperature means more males.</p>

<p> The other species that is at risk of extinction is the North Atlantic Right Whale. These whales were almost annihilated by hunters just for their meat which is rich in oil which is
     known as blubber, and that is why Currently they are one of the largest mammalian species in the oceans, in danger of extinction there are only about 400 whales left, and they are
      a few reproductive females. During this time they are protected from illegal hunting, but the recovery of the species is slow. The females do not reproduce for the first ten years
       of their lives and then give birth to one calf every six to ten years. Another of the most important things that is affecting many of these endangered species, especially the North Atlantic Right whale,
        is climate change or also known as global warming, and that is affecting these endangered mammals. . It is the climatic change that affects the temperature of the ocean that is 
        influencing the amount of food, which will have an impact on the rates of survival and reproduction. to keep their kind safe.

<p>Taking a cue from their extinct relative, the dodo, toothed pigeons are disappearing at an alarming rate. Its habitat is the tropical forests of Samoa and other nearby places, currently 
    there are around 70 or 380, in the wild, this time they are very elusive and very rarely seen. In the past, indiscriminate hunting played a major role in their decline, killing thousands
     of their kind. At present, their hunting is illegal, but they are still accidentally killed while hunting other species. In these times, one of its main threats to the species is listed 
     as Critically Endangered. Due to the interactive threats of human-caused habitat loss, habitat damage caused by natural phenomena, and invasive species, the increased mortality of this 
     species is human-caused.

    <p>These  Gharial unfortunately are now on the verge of extinction. There are only an estimated 100-300 in the wild. Its decline is due to various issues, although all 
        of these issues are caused by humans. The problems are the loss of their habitat, pollution and one of the biggest is entanglement in fishing nets, this only shows some of the biggest.
        Other things that are affecting and threatening this species are crocodile hunters, who use them as natural or traditional medicine.

            <p> Unfortunately, next on the list are the Amur leopards, one of the world's largest cat families in severe danger of extinction. This species is on the red list to disappear. 
                According to the investigation of the IUCN, which is an organization that is dedicated to protecting natural resources, they investigated that in the years 2014 and 2015, 
                there are only an approximate of 92 Amur leopards, according to other data, there are currently around 84 felines including males and females within their natural habitat.
                 Like all species on the list that are in danger of extinction. The Man is the main predator of these animals, which are hunted to commercialize their beautiful skins, as
                  well as their bones, which are sold for the use of traditional or natural Asian medicine. They are also at risk of losing their natural habitat, mainly due to natural and 
                  human-caused fires. Climate change is also playing a major role in modifying their means of existence. Of the Amur leopard. supposedly there are only 84 amur leopards but
                   there are more than what was mentioned but according to other investigations there are approximately 120 adult felines.

            <img src="https://wildwhales.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/vaquita.jpg "alt="a fish that look like a Dolphin">
<p>
 The vaquita is one of the smallest marine mammals with a huge danger of extinction, in the terrestrial globe. It is classified as Critically Endangered from disappearing from marine life.
 The IUCN did a thorough investigation in 1996, and in 2018, they roughly estimated that there were around 6 to 22 vaquitas left of their species. But the last investigation made by the 
IUCN organization, in 2019, discovered that there is only the minimum number of only 9 vaquitas in its species. What harms this species is illegal fishing for the cause of having the fish 
called totoaba, a large and highly commercialized fish due to its high benefit to the human body. The vaquitas end up trapped between the gillnets set to hunt the totoaba and therefore the
 vaquitas end up drowning because they can no longer swim to the surface to take in the oxygen they need to survive. To try to conserve these mammals, carried a ban on gillnets in vaquita
  habitat in 2016, illegal fishing continues and the threat to vaquitas remains. Local governments try to enforce the law and ban gillnets and penalize fishermen who use them. To conserve 
  existence, conservationists fight to reduce the demand for totoaba, which is a protected species. to avoid the hunting of the vaquitas.
